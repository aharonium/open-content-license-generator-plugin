This plugin is a fork of Creative Commons Generator by OptimalDevs (Alejandro Galvez and Andy Hernandez)
https://wordpress.org/plugins/creative-commons-generator/

The main difference in this fork is that it only provides options for the three Open Content compatible licenses authored and maintained by Creative Commons: CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC 0 (the Public Domain dedication). The plugin also offers an option to select a Fair Use statement as an exceptional case for when copyrighted work is shared. Additionally, rather than relying on "official" Creative Commons license images, this plugin offers clear and neutral license iconography.

Right now, to function properly, one of the plugin files (ccg-admin.php) needs to be edited directly with the domain name and path to where the images are stored.

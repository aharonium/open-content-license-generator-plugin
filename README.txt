This plugin displays your choice of an Open Content license below your posts in WordPress. All metadata included. 

== Description ==

Open Content License Generator allows you to choose an Open Content license to display under your blog posts indicating under what terms your work may be adopted, adapted, remixed, and redistributed. 

This plugin is a fork of the great Creative Commons Generator (CCG) by OptimalDevs (Alejandro Galvez and Andy Hernandez) <https://wordpress.org/plugins/creative-commons-generator/>. Unlike the CCG, the Open Content License Generator only provides a choice of content licenses compatible with the Open Knowledge Foundations definition of "open" <http://opendefinition.org/>, and the Free Culture Foundation's definition of "free" <http://freedomdefined.org/Definition>. The plugin also offers an option to select a Fair Use statement as an exceptional case for when copyrighted work is shared. In the future this plug-in may offer a choice of Open Content compatible licenses authored and maintained by organizations besides Creative Commons, for example, the Free Art license <http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses#Free_Art_License>.

Features:

* Open, standard license iconography designed by creativecommons.org.
